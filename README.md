# OOM lab exam 1
See `Lab Exam 1 - common.pdf` for the question

I've added the comments after the lab, so my official submission does not contain the comments. Otherwise, there are minimal differences between my submission and this.
If you are reading the code, I'd recommend reading it in the following order:
1. CompressorSize
1. Compressor
1. CoolingUnit
1. Freezer
1. AirConditioner
1. main.cpp
